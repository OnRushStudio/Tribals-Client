## 1.1.18 - 14 July 2023
I would like to send an announcement explaining what is going on with repair and party system.

We are rolling them out as commands for now as we work on the UI and Repair Table itself. This means you guys can now repair tools and invite friends to your parties and see each other on the map. Here is a little information about both:

# Party System
## The party system is something everyone can use, start out by typing `/party` or `/p` and it will show you what commands you can run with it.
- `/p create` - to create a party, the party ID is your username.
- `/p invite <username>` - invites a user to your party, this invite lasts until the server restarts.
- `/p join <username>` - joins a party if you have an invite.
- `/p leave` - leaves the party you are currently in.
- `/p kick <username>` - kicks a user from your party.
- `/p disband` - kicks everyone from the party and deletes it.
- There is a max of 5 users that can join the party (excluding the party owner)
- The other additions are that users can now see usernames above their party members heads, there is now a map icon for each party member on the map when you press m to open it, it also shows in the top right corner map too and you can see in chat when a party member leaves or dies.
# Repair System
## `/repair` this is a command that everyone can use as long as they are close to a toolbox they either own, or are authorized to.
- You must be holding a broken/damaged tool in order to repair it. The repair cost will be at least 1 of each resource it costs to repair. Other than that it will take a percentage of its durability lost in that round of damage and apply it to its craft cost divided by 2 to get its repair cost.
- A new system called "Lost Durability" was added, so each time you repair, your tool loses 20% of its max durability. So it will be worth repairing it up until some point. The red line is the lost Durability that it shows on tools.
- You must be within 3 units of a toolbox you own or are authorized to in order to repair the tool you are holding, if you are but you do not have the required items it will tell you in chat how much items it requires to repair.
## Items you can repair:
- Hatchet
- IronHatchet
- StonePickaxe
- IronPickaxe
- WoodenSpear
- StoneSpear
- IronSpear
- BoneKnife
- WoodenBow
*We are holding off on allowing repairs for guns for now as we figure out a good balance for them.*

We hope you enjoy this update, keep up the :tribbles: grind!

Some other changes
- Notes now save messages when sold in tradebox.

## 1.1.17 - 27 June 2023
- Some glitches fixed with ladder and roofs.
- Balance changes. Please read announcements.
- Only authorized users can upgrade buildings now.

We have seen raiders mostly go through walls/roofs and this is a problem as we’ve wanted to add traps to the game for a while but if people can raid through walls/roofs easier than doors, then it would be very unpredictable to know where people will go through. We want to make the raiding experience similar to Rust where going through doors is typically the best option for time and resources, but is not required.
# Buildings:
- All Wood Buildings are now 10,000 Health (or a little less depending on the structure)
- All Stone Buildings are now 25,000 Health (or a little less depending on the structure)
- Wooden door is now 5,000 Health
- Metal door is now 10,000 Health
# With this we’ve also changed some of the current raiding tools we've seen used.
# Tools:
- IronHatchet used to deal 12 damage to buildings, now it deals 8 damage but it still has its 800 Health. This should not be the primary tool for raiding.
- StoneSpear is now technically better than an IronHatchet, it does the same amount of damage but its health is 200 higher than the IronHatchet.
- IronSpear is now significantly better than all other weapons. It now has 1,200 Health and deals 12 damage to buildings.

If you have any suggestions for balance changes, please head to #feedback, click the Suggestion button, fill out all the fields and submit! Our staff will then review your suggestion to make sure it’s not a troll and accept it.

Thank you guys for your help in shaping this game and keep up the :tribbles: grind.
